# Classification of attacks on UNSW-NB15 dataset
Building an Intrusion Detection System on UNSW-NB15 Dataset Based on Machine Learning Algorithm

Binary classification of attack category.
The dataset has "label" with 0 and 1 where 0 represents non-attack and 1 represent attack.
So with the features available we will try to predict a given data point whether it belongs to attack or non-attack category.

Follow the instruction mentioned in notebooks. The execution order of the notebooks are:
1. About dataset and it's cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
4. Machine learning models and performance
5. Final function to predict any raw data
